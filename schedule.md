## Schedule of topics and readings

This schedule is tentative, and it is neither [_sound_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundness) (that is, if a particular reading or topic is listed here, that doesn't mean we'll cover it!) nor [_complete_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_(logic)) (that is, if a particular reading or topic is *not* listed here, that doesn't mean we *won't* cover it!).

The course will alternate between <span class="discussion">Discussion</span> and <span class="lecture">Lecture</span> days.  For days marked <span class="discussion">Discussion</span>, you must turn in your [reading response](course-overview.html#what-to-include-in-your-reading-response) for that day's reading assignment on Canvas **by noon Pacific time on the day prior to the day of class**.  For example, for the paper to be discussed on Wednesday, October 7, you must turn in your reading response on Canvas by noon Pacific time on Tuesday, October 6.
